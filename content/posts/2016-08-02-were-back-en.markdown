Hi everyone,

We’re pleased to announce [PyCon Canada 2016](https://2016.pycon.ca/) will be held **November 12-15** in the heart of downtown Toronto!

PyCon Canada is the largest Canadian gathering of users of Python (Pythonistas), with multiple talks and sprints to expand our horizons and forge connections across the community. [We’re in our fourth year](https://2016.pycon.ca/), and it’s shaping up to be our biggest conference yet.

 
Specific dates are as follows:

* November 12-13: Conference
* November 14-15: Sprints


## Submit Your Talk Today!

We are now officially calling for presenters to [submit talk proposals](https://cfp.pycon.ca/)! Part of what makes any conference great is the different viewpoints, experiences, and technologies that talks expose us to. We welcome speakers of all levels, from the seasoned veterans, to the newcomers. Your talk can be either 10 or 30 minutes long.
